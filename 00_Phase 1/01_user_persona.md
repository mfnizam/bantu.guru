## Target User Personas

#### **User Persona 1: "Ibu Fitri, The Modern Innovator"**

- **Background:** Ibu Fitri is a 32-year-old high school (SMA/SMK) English teacher in a medium-sized city like Bandung or Surabaya. She has been teaching for 8 years and is part of the millennial generation. She uses a laptop daily and has a good internet connection at home and school. She's active on professional social media groups and uses the Platform Merdeka Mengajar (PMM).
- **Goals:**
  - To make her English lessons highly engaging and relevant to current global events and pop culture to keep her digitally-native students interested.
  - To efficiently integrate new technologies and pedagogical approaches (like those encouraged by Kurikulum Merdeka) into her teaching.
  - To save time on content curation and focus more on student interaction and personalized feedback.
- **Pain Points:**
  - Finding up-to-date, culturally appropriate, and varied English content (articles, videos, interactive exercises) that goes beyond textbooks.
  - Transforming standard curriculum topics into creative, interactive, and project-based assignments without spending hours researching.
  - Ensuring her content caters to diverse learning styles within her class.

#### **User Persona 2: "Pak Budi, The Dedicated Adapter"**

- **Background:** Pak Budi is a 48-year-old middle school (SMP) Science teacher in a semi-urban area in Central Java. He has been teaching for over 20 years. He's a civil servant (PNS) and very dedicated to his students. While he primarily used traditional methods, the shift to Kurikulum Merdeka and the pandemic forced him to adopt digital tools. He now uses a smartphone for daily communication and accesses PMM for some resources, but he's not an early adopter of new software.
- **Goals:**
  - To effectively implement _Kurikulum Merdeka_ principles, especially in creating project-based learning and differentiated content for his science lessons.
  - To update his long-standing teaching materials with recent scientific discoveries or real-world Indonesian examples.
  - To make his lessons more interactive to keep students focused, even if he's not comfortable with complex digital tools.
- **Pain Points:**
  - Struggling to find reliable, simple-to-understand updated scientific information that aligns with the curriculum.
  - Feeling overwhelmed by complex software interfaces or tools that require extensive setup.
  - Limited time and confidence to "reinvent" his teaching style for the digital era.
  - Uneven internet access or older school equipment can sometimes be a barrier.
- **Tech Savviness:** Moderate. He's willing to learn but needs tools that are intuitive, straightforward, and provide clear step-by-step guidance. He prefers reliability over cutting-edge complexity.
- **How Bantu.guru can help him:** "Bantu.guru" can provide him with simple, AI-generated summaries of new scientific findings, culturally relevant examples to explain complex concepts, and pre-designed, easy-to-implement interactive activities. The tool needs to be highly user-friendly, perhaps with ready-to-use templates that minimize his digital burden.

- **Background:** Kak Sari is a 25-year-old history teacher in a private vocational high school (SMK Swasta) in West Java, working as a _guru honorer_ (contract/honorary teacher). Her salary is typically lower than a PNS teacher, and she might not have the same benefits or job security. She is digitally native, active on social media, and uses her smartphone for most tasks. She's passionate but often feels overworked and under-resourced.

  - To create engaging history lessons that connect past events to current Indonesian society and student lives.
