## Phase 1: Idea Validation & Deep Market Research

**Overview of Indonesian Teachers:**

- **Demographics:** The majority (71.97%) of teachers in Indonesia are female. A significant portion are millennials (51.95% as of August 2023), followed by Generation X (29.89%). There's also a growing number of younger teachers, especially in secondary vocational schools (SMK), where teachers under 35 make up 50%.
- **Technology Adoption:** There has been a notable increase in digital technology use among Indonesian teachers since 2022, driven by initiatives like Platform Merdeka Mengajar (PMM). Many teachers are active in digital learning communities.
- **Challenges:** While there's increased digital adoption, challenges persist. These include limited infrastructure (especially in rural areas), varied digital literacy levels, the need for continuous professional development in technology, and the complexities of adapting to the _Kurikulum Merdeka_ (Merdeka Curriculum). Teachers often struggle with administrative burdens and finding relevant, updated content that also encourages student engagement.
