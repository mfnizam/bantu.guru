
## Point 2C: Survey Results & Analysis â€“ Making Sense of the Data

Once the surveys are out and responses start coming in, this is how I'll approach analyzing the data to extract actionable insights.

**1. Data Collection & Initial Review:**

- **Automatic Collection:** Google Forms will automatically collect all responses in a spreadsheet format, which is incredibly convenient.
- **Initial Scan:** I'll do a quick scan of the first few dozen responses to get a feel for the general sentiment and spot any immediate outliers or common themes.

**2. Quantitative Analysis (The Numbers):**

I'll focus on getting percentages and frequencies for each multiple-choice and scale question. This will give me hard numbers to back up my assumptions.

- **Demographics:**
  - What's the age distribution of respondents? Does it align with my millennial/Gen X personas?
  - What are the most common school levels (SD, SMP, SMA/SMK) and subjects represented?
  - What's the ratio of PNS vs. Honorer teachers? This helps me understand the economic profile of my potential users.
- **Pain Point Prevalence:**
  - What percentage of teachers "Sering" (often) or "Sangat Sering" (very often) struggle with finding updated materials? This quantifies the problem.
  - What's the average time spent on lesson prep? This highlights the efficiency challenge.
  - Which digital tools are they _currently_ using? This tells me about their existing tech comfort and potential integration points.
- **Feature Interest:**
  - Which AI features received the most votes as "paling menarik" (most appealing)? This directly informs my MVP feature prioritization.
  - Which single feature did they "paling ingin coba terlebih dahulu"? This points to the absolute highest immediate value.
- **Willingness to Pay:**
  - What percentage selected "Gratis (versi dasar)"?
  - What's the distribution across the different price ranges (Rp 10.000 - Rp 25.000, Rp 25.001 - Rp 50.000, >Rp 50.000)? This will guide my initial pricing tiers.

**3. Qualitative Analysis (The Stories Behind the Numbers):**

This is where the open-ended questions truly shine. I'll read through every single response to the "tantangan terbesar" (biggest challenge) and "masukan lain" (other feedback) questions.

- **Thematic Analysis:** I'll look for recurring keywords, phrases, and ideas.
  - Are many teachers mentioning "kurikulum merdeka" adaptation issues?
  - Do they frequently bring up specific subjects being harder to update (e.g., IPS/Social Studies, IT)?
  - Are there common complaints about administrative burdens that my tool _could_ indirectly help with?
  - Are there any surprising insights or needs that I haven't even considered?
- **"Voice of the Customer":** I'll pull out powerful quotes or specific examples that vividly illustrate their pain points or excitement for the solution. These can be great for future marketing messages.

**4. Synthesizing the Findings & Actionable Insights:**

Once I've crunched the numbers and read through the qualitative data, I'll consolidate everything into a concise summary document.

- **Key Takeaways:** What are the top 3-5 most important insights from the survey?
- **Persona Validation/Refinement:** Do my initial personas (Ibu Fitri, Pak Budi, Kak Sari) still hold true, or do I need to tweak them based on the data? For instance, maybe there's a stronger need from vocational teachers (SMK) than I initially thought.
- **MVP Feature Confirmation:** Based on the "paling ingin coba terlebih dahulu" data and the biggest pain points, I'll finalize the _absolute core feature_ for my MVP. This is critical for staying focused.
- **Pricing Direction:** The willingness-to-pay data will give me a realistic starting point for my pricing model (e.g., solidifying the IDR 20,000/month initial pricing with a clear path to a freemium model).
- **Marketing Language:** The exact words and phrases teachers use to describe their problems and desired solutions will become invaluable for my website copy and marketing materials.
- **Next Steps:** What does this data tell me about what I need to build next in Phase 2? Does it highlight any specific integrations I should consider (e.g., with PMM (Platform Merdeka Mengajar) if many teachers use it)?

By following this rigorous analysis, I'll transform raw survey data into clear, actionable intelligence that drives the development of "Bantu.guru."
