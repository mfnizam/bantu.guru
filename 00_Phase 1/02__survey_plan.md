## Point 2: My Validation Plan – Surveys First!

This is my game plan for **Phase 1, Point 2: In-depth Teacher Interviews & Surveys**. Given that I’m juggling two jobs right now, my priority for getting feedback is going to be through **surveys**. They’re efficient and allow me to reach a broader audience without needing to schedule a ton of one-on-one sessions, which would be tough with my current workload. However, if some teachers are very enthusiastic, I’m open to quick follow-up calls.

**What I'm Trying to Achieve:**

My main goal with these surveys is to validate the assumptions I've made about my target personas and my core idea. I need to know:

1.  **Are these pain points real and widespread for Indonesian teachers?** I'm talking specifically about the struggle to keep lecture materials updated, relevant, and engaging.
2.  **Do teachers see value in an AI-powered solution for these problems?** Are my proposed AI features (like current event integration, interactive activity generation, or content refreshing) genuinely appealing?
3.  **What are their absolute _most pressing_ needs?** This will help me narrow down the MVP features.
4.  **How often will the use such a toll?** This helps me calculate the AI cost and build the pricing strategy.
4.  **What's their general willingness to pay for such a tool?** This helps me refine my pricing strategy.
5.  **Are there any unexpected insights or problems I haven't even thought of?**

**My Strategy for Validation:**

I'll be designing a concise, clear survey in Bahasa Indonesia. My primary channel for distribution will be the "Bantu Guru Belajar Lagi" LSM's community, as they're already focused on teacher development and have a strong, relevant following. I'll also consider other online teacher groups as backup channels.

The feedback from these surveys will directly inform my MVP development. It's about listening to the teachers first, before I build anything substantial.
